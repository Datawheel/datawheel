Applicants should have proficiency with Sketch and the Adobe Creative Suite. A strong candidate for this position has experience in utilizing user research to guide design decisions. Proficiency in HTML, CSS, and Javascript and/or industry standard prototyping tools is not necessary, but a definite plus.

* Proficiency with Sketch and/or Adobe Creative Suite
* Familiarity with HTML and CSS
