Alex comes to Datawheel from the MIT Media Lab, where he focused on data decision-making tools and using visual techniques to understand data, in addition to creating the OEC as his masterâ€™s thesis.

Besides data and design, Alex spends his free time engaging in every type of art. He even plays guitar in a band called The Hard Clean.
