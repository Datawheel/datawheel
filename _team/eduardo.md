Eduardo is an Industrial Engineer from Universidad de Concepción, but his programming background was only recently acquired. He had his first taste of working with code when he entered — and won — a challenge to visualize healthcare efficiency, via Hospital Las Higueras.<br/><br/>

When not working, he spends his free time reading novels, racing and throwing turtle shells, smashing Nintendo characters off stages, and <em>GO</em>ing outside to catch Pokémon.
