Nicolas is an industrial engineer from the University of Concepcion and a lover of music and technology. He has previously worked on data visualization platforms for decision making.<br /><br />

If you see him on his computer, he will probably be programming, playing Counter Strike or watching a game of Team Liquid, the team of his life. If he is AFK, then you will find him playing guitar and singing next to a campfire or sleeping.
