James grew up in Tampa, FL, where he obtained a relatively unimpressive BA in Advertising at USF. He later moved to Boston, MA in his search for things like seasons and culture. After designing and building marketing websites at a tiny advertising agency for a few years, he's now excited to solve the problem of making complex data digestible and understandable.

James also likes to spend an excessive amount of time writing progressive rock music and playing video games.
