Nick is currently studying computer science and interaction design at Northeastern University. He is super excited about all things web development and is fascinated by the intersection of art, data, and technology. In his free time Nick loves writing and recording music, running, and creating algorithmic art and (mostly impractical, whimsical, and fun) experimental web apps.
