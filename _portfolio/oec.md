desc: "What started as a master's thesis for Datawheel's Alexander Simoes has since become the internet's epicenter of international trade data. The Observatory of Economic Complexity visualizes over 50 years of UN Comtrade data in one easy to use, public interface. Using a new form of visualization known as the Product Space, the OEC provides its users with coherent visual narratives about the trade economies of over 200 countries."
