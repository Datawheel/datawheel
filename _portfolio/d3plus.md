desc: "As Datawheel began to take shape, it became clear that the existing tools for data visualization werenâ€™t going to be enough. D3plus to the rescue. The open-source brainchild of Datawheel co-founders Alexander Simoes and Dave Landry, D3plus acts as an extension to the wildly popular D3 library. With D3plus, beautiful data visualizations are possible in only a few lines of code."

  - "Think of D3plus as the shortcut to great visualizations. After only setting a few parameters specific to your data, D3plus will handle all the generic stuff that is normally taken for granted, such as setting up mouse events, color assignment, and label placement."
  - "D3plus is completely open-source and community driven. There are <a href='https://d3plus.org/examples/'>dozens of examples</a> on the project page, and a large user-base leading <a href='https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/d3plus'>discussions</a> and tracking <a href='https://github.com/alexandersimoes/d3plus/issues'>bugs and feature requests</a>."
  - "Additionally, D3plus tackles some of the biggest problems facing SVG web graphics, such as <a href='https://d3plus.org/examples/utilities/a39f0c3fc52804ee859a/'>smart text wrapping</a> and <a href='https://d3plus.org/blog/behind-the-scenes/2014/07/08/largest-rect/'>inner bounds detection on polygons</a>. It does the hard work for you."
